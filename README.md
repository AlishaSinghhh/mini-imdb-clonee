# Mini IMDB Clone

This project is a **Mini IMDB Clone** that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and manage a list of their favorite movies. The app utilizes **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with **Bootstrap** for styling and the **OMDB API** to fetch movie data.

## Features:
- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies by name, and the results are displayed in real-time.
- **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie provides detailed information about the movie, such as the plot, director, actors, and more.
- **Favorites**: Users can add movies to their **favorites list** and remove them when needed.
- **Persistent Favorites**: The favorites list is saved in **localStorage**, so it persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, making it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
